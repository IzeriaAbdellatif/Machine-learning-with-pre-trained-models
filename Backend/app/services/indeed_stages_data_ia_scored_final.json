    "title": "Tech - Junior DevOps Engineer - Casablanca",
    "company": "Infomineo",
    "location": "Casablanca",
    "description": "About us\nInfomineo is a pioneering global AI-enhanced research company that transforms how businesses access, analyze, and act on critical intelligence. We've evolved from traditional business research outsourcing to become the strategic partner that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with deep human expertise. We offer 3 services to our global clients (leading consulting companies, Fortune 500 companies, and government entities): AI and Data Advisory, Next-Gen Insights and Resource Scaling. This is made possible by relying on 3 pillars of excellence: 1) 350+ industry experts spread across 5 offices (Cairo, Casablanca, Mexico City, Dubai, Barcelona), 2) Our proprietary AI orchestrator, 3) Extensive knowledge assets combining 500,000+ delivered case studies and database subscriptions.\nReady to kick start your career with us?\nAbout the role\nWe are seeking a proactive IT Engineer to join our team, focusing on DevOps and infrastructure support. In this role, you will play a crucial part in maintaining and enhancing our core IT infrastructure, while also assisting in the implementation of automation and cloud-native DevOps practices. This position is ideal for someone who is passionate about both system reliability and process automation, and who thrives on tackling a diverse range of technical challenges.\nWho we are?\nWe are builders and learners at heart. At BRAIN, you’ll help shape what we build. We combine clear data, solid engineering, and thoughtful design to solve real problems.\nImpact from Day One: We don't believe in \"busy work.\" Whether you are building features, deploying infrastructure or researching user needs, your work will directly shape live products and real business outcomes.\nA Culture of Experimentation: We embrace the scientific method in everything we do. We build, we measure, we learn, and we iterate. Failure isn't punished; it's data for the next breakthrough.\nCutting-Edge Tech Stack: From Agentic AI and Kubernetes orchestration to advanced Statistical Modeling, you will work with the tools that define the modern tech landscape.\nGrowth-Oriented Environment: We invest in your potential. You will have mentorship from senior leaders and the autonomy to grow into technical and non technical leadership roles.\nAgile & Collaborative: We work in fast-paced sprints where engineering, design, and product sit at the same table.\nAbout the role\nWe are seeking an automation-driven and infrastructure-focused Junior DevOps Engineer to join our Tech Team. This role operates at the intersection of development velocity and operational stability. You will not only maintain the cloud environment but actively shape how software is delivered.\nYou will be responsible for the end-to-end delivery lifecycle: from defining infrastructure as code to orchestrating containerized applications, and finally implementing GitOps workflows. You will be the bridge between code contribution and production deployment, ensuring we build systems that are scalable, resilient, and fully automated.\nWhat you will do\nInfrastructure as Code & Cloud Architecture\nDefine & Provision: Use Terraform to define, provision, and manage infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will move away from manual \"ClickOps\" to rigorous Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.\nState Management: Maintain clean Terraform state files and modules to ensure environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) remain consistent and reproducible.\nResource Optimization: Monitor GCP usage to suggest cost-effective configurations without compromising on performance or security.\n2. Containerization & Orchestration\nContainerize: collaborate with developers to create optimized Docker images. You are expected to ensure images are lightweight, secure, and follow best practices.\nOrchestrate Scalability: Manage and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters. You will guide the team through configuring pods, services, and ingress controllers to ensure high availability.\nHelm Chart Management: Create and maintain Helm charts to package applications for easy deployment into the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n3. CI/CD Pipelines & GitOps\nAutomate Workflows: Design and implement robust CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. You will answer: \"How can we test and build code faster without breaking the build?\"\nImplement GitOps: Utilize ArgoCD to synchronize the cluster state with the Git repository. You will be the gatekeeper who ensures that the \"Source of Truth\" is always version-controlled code, not manual server changes.\nRelease Strategies: Assist in setting up deployment strategies (Canary, Blue/Green) to minimize downtime during updates.\n4. Reliability & Cross-Functional Collaboration\nPartner with Software Engineers to improve the \"Developer Experience\" (DevEx), making it easier for them to ship code independently.\nWork closely with the Product team to ensure infrastructure scales to meet business demands.\nImplement monitoring and alerting to detect issues before they impact the end-user.\nWho you are\nEducation & Experience\nEducation: Degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology, or a related field.\nExperience: 1-3 years of experience within engineering or operations teams (internships included).\nTechnical Proficiency\nCloud & IaC: Proficiency in Terraform and GCP (Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud SQL).\nContainerization: Strong grasp of Docker fundamentals and Kubernetes architecture (Pods, Nodes, Services).\nCI/CD & GitOps: Experience building pipelines with GitHub Actions and managing deployments with ArgoCD.\nVersion Control: Deep understanding of Git and GitHub workflows (Branching, Pull Requests, Merging).\nScripting: Basic proficiency in Bash or Python for automation tasks.\nNetworking: Proficiency with DNS, Load Balancing, Firewalls, Networking and Security.\nSoft Skills\nProblem Solving: A relentless drive to fix root causes rather than patching symptoms. You enjoy debugging complex systems.\nAutomation Mindset: A healthy skepticism of manual tasks. If you have to do it twice, you automate it.\nCommunication: The ability to explain complex infrastructure concepts to developers and non-technical stakeholders clearly.\nNice-to-Haves\nExperience with Helm for Kubernetes package management.\nKnowledge of monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.\nWhat we offer\nA competitive salary\nA great working environment & fast-track career trajectory\nA healthy work-life balance\nHealth insurance benefits\nWhat is it like to work at Infomineo?\nIf you've spoken with someone who works at Infomineo, you've probably heard that our people are our most valuable asset. Our diverse team—across both professional experience and culture—is the company’s greatest strength.\nBy joining Infomineo, you'll have the opportunity to work alongside a talented, innovative, and global team of IT professionals who value problem-solving and technological creativity. You'll gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools, methodologies, and systems used in IT research and development. You'll have the chance to grow your career and expertise while collaborating on projects across various industries and regions. As a key member of the team, you'll contribute your ideas and skills, helping drive the company’s technological advancements and supporting leading international institutions and companies with data, systems, and IT solutions that power key business decisions.\nEqual opportunity employee\nInfomineo is an equal opportunity employer, we prohibit any sort of discrimination (based on color, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, or any other attributes) in all aspects of employment (recruiting, hiring, wages and salary, promotions, benefits, training, and job termination).\nIf you believe you match our requirements and values, we would be happy to hear from you.
